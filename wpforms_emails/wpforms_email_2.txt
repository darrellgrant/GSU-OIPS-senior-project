Hi Darrell,

Thank you for contacting us!

We don't currently have any built-in way to send data to a custom database, but you could accomplish this with some custom code. Here's a tutorial from a developer and friend to our team, Bill Erickson: https://www.billerickson.net/contact-form-integration/

While we aren't able to provide support for this level of customization, I hope this helps you to get a better idea of how this could work!

In case it helps, our Zapier addon can also connect to a bunch of other services (Zapier is essentially a 'connector' to create integrations) -- so it may be worth checking if your database is on their list of available integrations, which would let you avoid custom code: https://zapier.com/apps/integrations.

Our Zapier addon is available with our Pro license level or higher (https://wpforms.com/pricing/). 

I hope this helps! Could you please let me know if you have any other questions?

Thanks! :)



How would you rate my reply?
Great    Okay    Not Good
